# tezos-beacon-idonly
Sample code to get a Tezos wallet address/ID via Beacon.

This example is simply taken from https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-sdk/blob/master/example-dapp.html but stripped down to only handle wallet address/ID retrieval.

## Important:

*Never trust pre-built libraries in production.*

This example is for demo purposes only. In your project please build your own `walletbeacon.min.js` from the [Beacon SDK source](https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-sdk).
